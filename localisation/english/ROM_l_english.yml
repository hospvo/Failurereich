 ROM_legacy_of_carol_ii_desc: "When Ferdinand I. died, he gave the throne to his grandson Michael I. But, he is now too young to rule by himself. This situation was used by his father Carol, who came back from exile. He usurped crone from his son and crowned himself as King Carol II. His lifestyle is causing damage to crown prestige. What is even that his parties and costly cars, villas, and concubines are taking a toll on the nation's budget. This chaos needs to end, or he can bring the population against the monarchy, which can end by supporting leftists and the abolition of the monarchy and when the facist coup the king carol ii only figure of them"

 # Event Descriptions
 romania_michael.1.d:0 "The Romanian Communist Party faces a crucial decision regarding King Michael. The young monarch, still popular among the people, could either be maintained as a stabilizing figure or removed in favor of pure socialist governance. Lucreţiu Pătrășcanu argues for pragmatism, suggesting that keeping Michael as a constitutional monarch could ease our transition to socialism. However, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and his supporters insist that true socialism cannot coexist with monarchy.\n\nOur decision today will shape Romania's future path to socialism."
 
 romania_michael.2.d:0 "In an unprecedented public address, King Michael has spoken in support of Romania's socialist transformation. Speaking from the balcony of the newly renamed People's Palace, the young king emphasized the need for social progress and expressed his commitment to working with the communist government for the benefit of all Romanians.\n\nWearing a simple military uniform rather than royal regalia, Michael's modest appearance and progressive message have resonated with both traditionalists and revolutionaries."

 romania_michael_news.1.d:0 "In an unprecedented development, Romania's communist government has announced its decision to maintain the monarchy, with King Michael remaining as a constitutional head of state. This unique arrangement, dubbed 'Royal Socialism' by some observers, represents a distinctly Romanian path to socialism.\n\nLucreţiu Pătrășcanu, the new communist leader, has emphasized that this decision reflects Romania's specific conditions and historical traditions."

 romania_michael_news.2.d:0 "The Romanian Communist Party has formally abolished the monarchy, with King Michael being forced to abdicate. Under the leadership of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Romania has declared itself a people's republic, following the more traditional socialist model.\n\nThis decision marks a definitive break with Romania's monarchical past and signals closer alignment with orthodox communist principles."
